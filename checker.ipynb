      "Perfect). Table 6(b) displays the corresponding credit matrix. Level-1 Weight0.5 Accuracy: Here a partial credit of 0.5 was rewarded if the classiﬁer prediction was incorrect by one level. The credit matrix corresponds to the one shown in Table 6(b), but 0.25 replaced with 0.5. Level-2 Weight0.25,0.5 Accuracy: This is our most lenient classiﬁer which rewarded a partial credit of 0.5 for misclassiﬁcation by one level and a partial credit of 0.25 for mis-classiﬁcations by two levels (Table 6(c)). We compared the performance of our language classiﬁer against two baseline classiﬁers: 1) Random-Guess baseline and 2) Random-Weighted-Guess baseline. In the random guess classiﬁer, every credibility class had an equal probability of being selected. Hence the classiﬁer randomly guessed and predicted any of the four possible credibility categories. On the other hand, the predictions of random-weighted guess classiﬁer were based on the proportion of instances that belonged to each credibility class in our dataset. We opted for the random guess baseline classiﬁers over a choose-most-frequent-class baseline so as to illustrate a sensible baseline performance for each credibility category. We performed McNemar's test of signiﬁcance to compare the accuracy of our language classiﬁer with that of the baseline. McNemar's test, which assessed whether the proportion of correct and incorrect classiﬁcations in the two systems are signiﬁcantly different, indicated that even with the most conservative approach employing an unweighted credit matrix, our language classiﬁer accuracy was signiﬁcantly higher compared to both the baseline classiﬁers (p < 10−16). Table 5 shows the precision, recall and F1 measures for each credibility class under different accuracy measurement schemes as well as the overall accuracy under each scheme. DISCUSSION According to our ﬁndings, the top predictive linguistic features associated with higher perceived credibility mostly comprise linguistic measures. The only control variable in the top 100 predictors of high credibility scores was average retweet length (β = 0.25), while average reply length (β = 0.18) fell within the top 200 positive predictors. Similarly, top predictive features of lower perceived credibility scores were phrases from our language categories. Number of retweets (β = – 0.27) was the only control in the topmost 50 predictors of low perceived credibility scores. This indicates that while higher number of retweets were correlated with lower credibility scores, retweets and replies with longer message lengths were associated with higher credibility scores. An explanation of this could be that longer message length of retweets and replies denote more information and greater reasoning, leading to higher perceived credibility. On the other hand, higher number of retweets (marker of lower perceived credibility score) might represent an attempt to elicit collective reasoning or ascertain situational awareness during times of crisis and uncertainty [61]. Session: Content QualityCSCW 2017, February 25–March 1, 2017, Portland, OR, USA134 Figure 1: The predictive power of the linguistic measures from the omnibus model. A measure's weight is proportional to the deviance of the corresponding linguistic category (Table 4 lists the deviance numbers). The color saturation corresponds to the difference in the absolute values of positive and negative β weights of the coefﬁcients belonging to the linguistic category. The color spans from red to green with a higher concentration of red denoting that the sum of negative βs is higher than the sum of positive βs, while the converse is true for higher concentration of green. The diagram also lists the top predictive phrases in each linguistic measure. Among non-lexicon based features, fraction of quotations in original tweets was negatively correlated with credibility (β = – 0.097). Indeed, a key pragmatic goal of messages with quoted content is to convey uncertainty and provenance of information while refraining from taking complete accountability of the message's claim [68]. Taking a closer look at our most predictive words in each lexicon, we found a striking view of words and phrases signaling perceived credibility level of social media event reportages (see Figure 1 for an overview).
